⏪ I’ve previously worked on:
- [`supply_chain_simulator`](https://github.com/orangewit3/supply_chain_simulator): a project in collab with University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to simulate supply chain operations of commodities on Ethereum

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Rust 🦀,
- WebAssembly, 
- TypeScript,
- Working to build a **test** routine with `react-testing-library` + `cypress` + `jest` to test all the code I write, and
- Ethereum L2 full-stack development 

⚡ Fun fact: 
- During a 2 year haitus from uni, I dropped out to devote my life to becoming a music producer (i.e. I have quite a lot of experience in making radio ready 🎼 🎶 in Ableton 💽), briefly worked as a server in Chicago music theatre’s, became passionate about crypto and blockchains, and lastly, worked at a niche donut shop downtown
